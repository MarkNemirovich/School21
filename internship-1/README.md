***Postscriptum:***

You suddenly woke up to something that sounded like the banging of a door:

*-- Rise and shine, come on! Today's the big day, you can't sleep through the start of your internship*, a familiar voice came from somewhere near your ear.

You were struggling to keep your eyes open, your head was reaching for the pillow, the blanket was wrapping itself around you, but your brain was already beginning to wake up, and the room was modeling itself. You were replaying the events of the dream in your head, which were surprisingly long and clear. Unfortunately, the longer you thought about it, the more it blurred. Some AI and a megacorporation, rebellious developers. It all didn't add up anymore, even though it seemed colorful.

*-- Get up, you sleepyhead!* came from the other room. You got out of bed and took the first step toward your future...

### Introduction

Finally, your long and thorny path of the core program comes to its logical conclusion in a form of a full internship, which you will undergo for three months in a real company, for which we congratulate you sincerely! We hope that you have learned many new and valuable things, found interesting acquaintances during the time spent on the "core". :) \
You already have a certain set of knowledge and experience at this point, which can be further consolidated and tested in action on real-world tasks. It is all right if you feel that you are not ready or that your knowledge may not be enough. After all, the whole internship project is exactly the same educational stage as all the projects before it, which will help you learn many new things: to have an inside look at the industry, to try your hand at the inner kitchen of the IT sphere outside of the School's projects. 
It will also help you decide in what direction you want to grow and what you want to pursue in your career: getting into back-end development, dealing with real-time, high-load systems, setting up and administering corporate networks, or even starting your own IT start-up.

In this project you will need to pass *3* main stages:

1. Searching and selecting a company and a vacancy;
2. Enrolling and completing an internship;
3. Making a report on the results of the internship.

Also, you will need to pass *2* stages of evaluation of your internship: one from your curator (or mentor) in the company, another from the peers who will listen carefully to your internship report. So be sure to take your report as seriously as possible so that any peer who reviews you can understand what you did and what you were working on during your internship.


## Chapter II

### Part 0. Vacancy Search and Selection

Before starting the project, you need to choose a company and a vacancy in it for an internship. Your choice of vacancy is subject to the following restrictions and conditions:
- Duration of the internship is **3** months
- Employment must be **at least 20 hours a week** (*part-time*)
- The vacancy should be closely related to programming, i.e. **at least 30%** of your working time should be spent **exactly** on *coding*. Yep, just "UI/UX designer", "system administrator" or "business analyst" won't do
- The company should provide a *curator* or an *advisor* (*mentor*) who will accompany you throughout your internship, give you feedback, and actually evaluate your work. If the company does not have a full-fledged internship program, then discuss with your supervisor who you can consider to be your mentor - himself, a senior colleague from your department, or even a product manager (which, however, is highly undesirable).

Note, that there is an option of getting a job as a junior developer or higher, if all of the above criteria, applicable to the internship, are fulfilled.

As a report at this stage it is necessary to prepare a small markdown file *src/search.md* with a description of the chosen vacancy, requirements to it and description of the company where the internship will take place.

### Part 1. The Internship

Once you have selected a position that meets all the conditions, you need to sign an agreement or contract for an internship with the company of your choice. And don't forget to upload this document to Applicant, as internships cannot be validated with past periods! Note that the dates in the document must cover the dates of the internship as a project. \
Over the next 3 months, you will have exciting real-world tasks and hard work waiting for you, so - good luck! And may the Power of Verter be with you :)

### Part 2. Making a report on the results of the internship.

Within 3 months, you must prepare a report in the presentation format with a story about the company, your position and the duties, including the tasks you did during the internship. Be sure to include the following information in your report:

1. A short story about the company, what kind of projects they do, what kind of corporate culture they have?

2. A short story about your position in the company. In which functional unit/department you worked? What were your daily tasks?

3. A short story about the structure of the project team or functional unit in which you did an internship, as well as the accepted methodology for organizing project work, the processes and tools used.

4. A description of the tasks you completed (with examples of your least favorite task and most favorite one), what you did during your internship, and which project(s) you worked on. As a brief analysis of your work, also provide statistics on the tasks assigned to you: their total number, the number of tasks successfully completed, the number of tasks returned in progress, and the average time spent on the task. Specify what skills/qualities you have acquired and what skills/qualities you have used (not only technical ones!) during the internship with examples of situations
5. The results of your internship. What you have achieved? What you have contributed to the company and the project(s) you directly worked on?

When making the report, be sure to consult with your curator or mentor about what can and cannot be shared publicly - perhaps some of the details of the organizational structure or project activities are considered confidential. In that case, try to summarize your story without going into details or specifics.

Also note that your speech and presentation will be listened to by other peers who may not know anything about the company or your work. Therefore, your main task is to structure your presentation and story in such a way that absolutely any listener can understand what you did there. Your final grade will depend on your ability to explain to the peers what your job was.

The total length of your speech must be **between 5 and 7 minutes**. So try to be detailed, but to the point. And be sure to prepare your text ahead of time so you don't waste time improvising.

The presentation must be uploaded to the repository in the *src* folder with the filename *internship_pres*.

The report must be prepared during the internship and uploaded to the platform before the mentor gives you the second grade.
